# MSFFiles
Commonly used compositions, scripts, and other files used by the MSF Arma 3 milsim unit.

# Scripts
Currently we've got 19 small unoptimized scripts to spawn vehicles on our main spawn composition. I'm working on reducing that number.

# Functions
Functions no worky right now, working those out on my working branch

# Compositions
Current compositions: a limited arsenal with rules compliant gear and the MotherBasev4 Spawn comp.
