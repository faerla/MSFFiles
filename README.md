# MSFFiles
Commonly used compositions, scripts, and other files used by the MSF Arma 3 milsim unit.

# Scripts
Currently we've got 19 small unoptimized scripts to spawn vehicles on our main spawn composition. I'm working on reducing that number.

# Functions
I've got a single function that basically saves no work but enables the helicopter and jeeps spawners. Hopefully I can expand this so we can use the spawner for the airfield without 7 separate scripts.

# Compositions
Current compositions: a limited arsenal with rules compliant gear and the MotherBasev4 Spawn comp.
