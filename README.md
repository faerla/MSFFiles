# MSFFiles
Commonly used compositions, scripts, and other files used by the MSF Arma 3 milsim unit.

#Scripts
Currently we've got 6 small unoptimized scripts to spawn vehicles on our main spawn composition. I'm working on reducing that number.

#Compositions
Current compositions: a limited arsenal with rules compliant gear and the MotherBasev4 Spawn comp.
